# Extension Handoff

**Updated:** 2026-06-30 (see **"Direction change: retire M1–M5, use the portal engine"** at the
top — decision pending). Prior: M1–M5 + path fix + Readability coverage fix shipped & pushed;
`main` merged in; "Save to TokenItDown" platform-save built.

## ⚠️ Direction change (2026-06-30) — retire the M1–M5 local pipeline, use the portal engine

**Why:** the portal now has a much stronger conversion engine than the extension's local
M1–M5 pipeline, and we want the extension to reuse it.

**Product intent (from the user):** clicking the extension should convert **the current page**
to Markdown and let the user **download or copy it right in the popup** — **no redirect to the
TokenItDown portal, and (ideally) no login**. The current "Save to TokenItDown" flow is close
but it (a) requires a signed-in session and (b) writes to the user's library; the new intent is
a friction-free convert-and-return.

**Hard constraint (load-bearing):** the portal's real conversion engine is **MarkItDown, which
runs server-side in Python** (`server/app/main.py`). **It cannot run inside the Chrome
extension.** So "use the portal's code" means either (a) call a server endpoint, or (b) only
port the parts that are pure TypeScript. The genuinely portable piece is the cleaner
**`lib/markdown/clean.ts`** (tiers raw/clean/compact, unicode/ligature fixes, PDF dehyphenation,
running-header removal, table normalization, web-chrome stripping, token metering) — it is much
stronger than the extension's `extension/src/lib/clean.ts`.

**Portal conversion stack (the "new files" to reuse):**
- `server/app/main.py` — FastAPI wrapper over `MarkItDown(enable_plugins=False)`:
  `POST /convert` (any file → MD via `convert_stream`) and `POST /convert-url` (SSRF-guarded,
  YouTube + web). Gated by the `MARKITDOWN_SERVICE_TOKEN` shared secret.
- `app/api/convert/route.ts` — auth'd file upload → `convertFile` → `cleanMarkdown(tier)` →
  `saveDocument` (persists original + raw + cleaned + token stats).
- `app/api/convert/url/route.ts` — auth'd `{url, tier}` → `convertUrl` →
  `cleanMarkdown(tier, {web:true})` → `saveDocument`.
- `lib/markitdown-client.ts` — `convertFile` / `convertUrl` (sends the service token).
- `lib/markdown/clean.ts` — the deterministic cleaner (pure TS, portable).

**Three candidate designs (ONE must be chosen before implementing):**
1. **Server, no-auth preview endpoint** — add an *unauthenticated* `POST /api/convert/preview`:
   extension posts the current page's rendered HTML, gets back MarkItDown+cleaned Markdown, **no
   `saveDocument`, no login, no redirect**. True portal engine. Cost: an open, unauthenticated
   compute endpoint (bound it with a size limit + no server-side fetch).
2. **Server, keep login but no redirect** — reuse the better-auth session cookie the extension
   already sends: if signed in, convert and **return** the Markdown to the popup (download/copy)
   **without** writing to the library or redirecting; prompt to sign in only if the session is
   missing. Portal engine, no open endpoint, but still needs a session.
3. **Fully client-side** — no backend: keep the extension's local Readability→Turndown
   extraction but **replace `extension/src/lib/clean.ts` with a port of `lib/markdown/clean.ts`**.
   Offline, no login. Close to portal quality on HTML pages but *not* identical (HTML→MD stays
   Turndown, not MarkItDown).

**Status: DECISION PENDING** — asked the user to pick 1/2/3; not yet answered. No code changed
for this direction yet. Whatever is chosen, the plan is to make convert-and-download-in-popup the
extension's primary behavior and retire the M1–M4 local pipeline (M5 CDP screenshot may be kept
as a separate optional output — TBD).

**Current extension wiring (unchanged, still in tree):** `handleSaveToLibrary` in
`service-worker.ts` already posts the page's rendered HTML (`GET_PAGE_HTML`) to `/api/convert`
via `lib/platform.ts` using the session cookie; the popup already offers a Markdown download
(`showSaveResult`) plus an "Open Library" link. Designs 1/2 are refinements of this seam.

---

**Branch:** `extension`
**What this is:** A Chrome MV3 extension under `extension/` that turns a web page into
clean, LLM-ready Markdown **plus** a full-page screenshot. Two output paths:
1. **Local pipeline** — capture → route (DOM/vision/hybrid) → describe visual regions →
   clean + token-report → download PNG/Markdown.
2. **Save to TokenItDown** — send the page's rendered HTML to the platform (`/api/convert`,
   markitdown) and save it to the signed-in user's library. See "Platform integration" below.

## Entry points (all built by Vite)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `popup/popup.{ts,html,css}` | Popup UI: "Capture Full Page" (local pipeline) + "Save page to TokenItDown" (platform) + "Convert via" target selector, progress, preview, route badge, token line, downloads |
| `service-worker.ts` | Orchestrates `START_CAPTURE` (extract → screenshot → describe → clean → `CAPTURE_DONE`) and `SAVE_TO_LIBRARY` (`handleSaveToLibrary` → platform) |
| `content-script.ts` | Auto-injected (`<all_urls>`); answers `GET_PAGE_METRICS` / `SCROLL_TO` / `HIDE_FIXED` / `EXTRACT_MARKDOWN` / `GET_PAGE_HTML`. `analyzePage()` runs M1+M2(+M3 placeholders) |
| `lib/captureCDP.ts` | **M5, primary capture.** `captureFullPageCDP(session)` — DevTools-Protocol single-pass screenshot (attach → `Page.captureScreenshot` w/ `captureBeyondViewport` → detach). CDP transport injected for testability |
| `lib/screenshot.ts` + `lib/stitch.ts` | **Fallback capture.** Scroll in viewport steps → composite frames on `OffscreenCanvas`. Used when CDP can't attach |
| `lib/extract.ts` | **M1.** `extractMarkdown(doc,url)` — Readability → Turndown(GFM); falls back to `<body>`. Returns `ExtractResult` (incl. `source`, `readerable`, `textLength`) |
| `lib/route.ts` | **M2.** `collectSignals(doc,extract)` + pure `decideRoute(signals)` → `dom` / `vision` / `hybrid` |
| `lib/regions.ts` | **M3.** `collectRegions(doc)`, `injectPlaceholders(clone,regions)`, `spliceDescriptions(md,map)` |
| `lib/crop.ts` | **M3/M5.** pure `regionPixelRect()` + `cropRegions(png,regions,cssPageWidth)` (measures scale from the image) |
| `lib/describe.ts` | **M3.** `RegionDescriber` interface + default `metadataDescriber` (caption/alt/dims, no model) + `describeRegions()` |
| `lib/clean.ts` | **M4.** `cleanMarkdown(md)` — boilerplate strip + dedupe (guards headings/blockquotes) |
| `lib/tokens.ts` | **M4.** `estimateTokens(text)` (~4 chars/token) + `tokenSavings(before,after)` |
| `lib/platform.ts` | **Platform save.** `convertHtmlToLibrary({baseUrl,html,filename})` — POST rendered HTML to `{base}/api/convert` (`credentials:include`); markitdown converts + saves to the library. `PlatformError` (`needsLogin` on 401) |
| `lib/config.ts` | Platform base URLs from `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (no hardcoded URLs) + per-user override in `chrome.storage` |
| `types.ts` | Shared message + data interfaces. `types/turndown-plugin-gfm.d.ts` — decl for the untyped plugin; `vite-env.d.ts` — `import.meta.env` typing |

## Build & test
```bash
cd extension && npm run build      # rebuilds dist/ (copies public/ → dist/, incl. icons)
cd extension && npm run typecheck  # zero TS errors
# from repo root:
npx vitest run extension/src/lib   # 73 unit tests (…+ platform5). Extension reads VITE_TOKENITDOWN_* from the repo-root .env (envDir: "..")
npm run e2e:extension              # 3 Playwright e2e (loads the unpacked extension)
```

---

## Status

**M1–M5, the content-script path fix, and the Readability coverage fix are done,
security-reviewed clean, live-verified, committed AND pushed** (local `extension` ==
`origin/extension`). `main` (the Next.js app + markitdown conversion service) is merged in.

**The "Save to TokenItDown" platform-save feature is built and verified but UNCOMMITTED**
(working tree): `lib/platform.ts` (+test), `lib/config.ts`, `vite-env.d.ts`, and changes to
`manifest.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `content-script.ts`, `service-worker.ts`, `popup.*`,
`types.ts`, `.env.example`. Security-reviewed clean. Suggested commits: (1) env/config wiring,
(2) the feature.

**73 unit + 3 e2e green; typecheck + build clean.**

**Manual testing works** for normal pages: toolbar **Capture Full Page** → screenshot +
route badge + token line + downloads; and **Save page to TokenItDown** → library (needs you
signed into the dashboard). Rebuild + reload at `chrome://extensions` after any change.

**Two open caveats** (details below): full button→download flow isn't auto-tested (needs
a toolbar gesture Playwright can't fake), and scroll-animated marketing sites distort the
screenshot.

## Architecture & pipeline

```
CAPTURE  full-page screenshot + live (post-render) DOM
   │
ROUTE    text density · readability · canvas/SVG/img area dominance
   ├── dom     Readability → Turndown          (text-heavy)
   ├── hybrid  DOM skeleton + region crops      (text + charts)
   └── vision  screenshot → vision → MD          (canvas/dashboards) — not built yet
   │
CLEAN    boilerplate strip · dedupe · token report
   │
OUTPUT   page.md + screenshot.png  (+ a11y-tree.yml, bundle upload — not built yet)
```

Key decisions: DOM is the Markdown source of truth where it has text (we read the live,
hydrated DOM, so SSR/CSR is irrelevant); the screenshot is a required output and doubles
as the crop source for hybrid; vision is the universal floor for canvas/image-text pages.
Later superpowers: `all_frames` for cross-origin iframes; scroll pass to accumulate
virtualized lists.

---

## Milestones (all ✅ DONE 2026-06-27)

**M1 — DOM→Markdown.** `extract.ts`: clone doc (Readability mutates), isolate the article,
convert to GFM Markdown, normalize blanks. **Coverage fallback** (`preferFullBody`): if
Readability's article covers < `COVERAGE_MIN` (0.6) of the page's visible text, convert the
whole `<body>` instead — Readability drops card grids / dashboards / footers on
marketing/app pages, so this recovers them (iotkinect: 5.9k → 15k chars; the M4 clean stage
then trims the chrome). `source` = `readability` (clean article) vs `fallback` (full body).
Popup gains Download Markdown (revocable Blob URL, `slugify(title).md`). Deps:
`@mozilla/readability`, `turndown`, `turndown-plugin-gfm`.

**M2 — Router.** `collectSignals` reads text length + readability + canvas/svg/img counts and
**area ratios** (`getBoundingClientRect` area ÷ page area). Pure `decideRoute`: text<200 →
vision; visualArea≥0.6 → vision; visualArea≥0.3 or canvasArea≥0.1 → hybrid; readable+
readability → dom; else dom (low confidence). Popup shows a colored route badge (tooltip =
reason).

**M3 — Hybrid vision-assist.** For hybrid pages: `collectRegions` (canvas/svg/figure/img,
deduped, ≥200×150 except figures, with page rects + labels), clone+`injectPlaceholders`
(`<p>TIDREGION<id>ENDREGION</p>` — pure-alphanumeric token survives Readability/Turndown),
re-extract so tokens land **inline**. Service worker crops each region from the screenshot,
describes it, `spliceDescriptions`. Default `metadataDescriber` uses caption/alt/dims (no
model) and emits `> **Figure:** …`. **Provider interface ready** — an LLM describer plugs
into the same seam (see "Open decisions").

**M4 — Clean + token report.** `cleanMarkdown` strips whole-line boilerplate (cookie/social/
newsletter/legal/nav-bar ≥4 links) + consecutive dups; **conservative** — never touches
headings or blockquotes (M3 descriptions), single links survive. `estimateTokens` (~4
chars/token, labelled `≈`) + `tokenSavings`. Cleaned Markdown is what downloads; popup
shows `≈ N tokens · −X% after cleaning`.

**M5 — CDP single-pass screenshot.** `captureFullPageCDP` via `chrome.debugger` is the
**primary** path (one compositor pass — no seams, captures fixed headers); scroll-stitch is
the fallback when attach fails (chrome:// / Web Store / DevTools attached / declined). Added
`"debugger"` permission.
- **Scale fix (surfaced here):** CDP renders at a device scale that is **not** necessarily
  `window.devicePixelRatio` (observed 1.5× while DPR=1.0). `cropRegions` now **measures**
  scale from `img.width / cssPageWidth` (`metrics.scrollWidth`) — correct for CDP *and*
  stitch images. `regionPixelRect` param `dpr` → `scale`.

---

## Capture quality (Strategy A shipped; B open)

The CDP path (M5 = **Strategy A**) fixes most scroll-stitch defects for normal pages: seams,
DPR resample, scrollbar stretch, sub-pixel seams, dropped fixed header, lazy-content settle.

**Strategy B — harden the scroll-stitch fallback** (still open; for the no-banner / restricted
-page path to reach GoFullPage parity):
1. Throttle `captureVisibleTab` to ≥500ms + retry on quota error.
2. Derive scale from captured image width; draw frames 1:1 at integer offsets.
3. Re-measure `scrollHeight` during the loop (lazy content grows the page).
4. Keep fixed elements on frame 1, hide for the rest.
5. Longer settle + dispatch scroll events + `await img.decode()` for lazy media.
6. Tile output past the 16384px canvas limit instead of cropping.

## Known limitations

- **Scroll-animated / pinned sites repeat the hero** (e.g. iotkinect.com → hero ~14× down a
  12,916px image). **Not a code bug** — confirmed in real Chrome that a `position:fixed`
  header captures correctly, and `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride` does *not* fix it.
  These sites (GSAP ScrollTrigger / `fullPage.js`) reveal panels one-per-scroll; the
  single-screen view only exists mid-scroll, so any full-page render stacks them. Markdown
  is unaffected (router picks DOM). *Future idea:* detect such pages (very tall `scrollHeight`
  + thin text) and prefer scroll-stitch, or warn. Lesson: **verify screenshot content, not
  just dimensions** — M5's dimension-only check missed this.
- **Animated counters / lazy sections read stale** — extraction runs *before* the page is
  scrolled, so count-up stats render as their initial value (iotkinect "200+/600+" → "0+")
  and reveal-on-scroll / carousel content can be missing. **Fix (pending):** a hydration
  scroll (top→bottom→top, with settle) before `EXTRACT_MARKDOWN`. Verified the values are
  correct once the page has been scrolled.
- **Full button→download flow isn't auto-tested.** `executeScript` and `captureVisibleTab`
  need the `activeTab` gesture granted by a real toolbar click, which Playwright can't do.
  `EXTRACT_MARKDOWN` (auto-injected content script) and the CDP capture (`chrome.debugger`)
  *don't* need the gesture, so they're driven directly in verification scripts. Verify the
  full click flow manually.

---

## e2e / tooling gotchas (load-bearing)

- **Service worker is IIFE, not ESM** — `vite-plugin-web-extension@4` hardcodes `iife`, so
  the manifest must NOT set `"type":"module"`.
- **Icons must live in `public/`** — the plugin doesn't bundle `icons`/`action.default_icon`;
  it copies `public/` → `dist/` verbatim. They're at `public/src/icons/`. (Chrome silently
  refuses to load an extension with missing referenced files.)
- **Content-script injected path is `src/content-script.js`** (the dist layout), with a
  `window.__tokenitdownContentLoaded` guard so the manifest auto-inject + capture re-inject
  don't register the message listener twice. *(This was the `Could not load file` bug — fixed.)*
- **Playwright extension loading:** `ignoreDefaultArgs: ["--disable-extensions",
  "--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages"]`; read the extension id from
  `context.serviceWorkers()` (the `serviceworker` event doesn't fire for extension SWs); use
  one shared context with a 10s teardown race (per-test `context.close()` hangs on Windows
  headed). Keep native Windows backslash paths for `--load-extension`.

---

## What's next

- **Real icons** — replace the 1×1 placeholders in `public/src/icons/` (keep them in `public/`).
- **Strategy B** — harden the scroll-stitch fallback (list above).
- **Bundle upload** — wire `page.md` + `screenshot.png` (+ a11y tree) into the authenticated
  platform upload (PLAN.md §4.4).
- **CI** — extension e2e needs `headless:false`; on Linux CI wrap with `xvfb-run` (separate job).

## Platform integration — "Save page to TokenItDown" (done)

The extension can send a page to the platform's conversion engine and save it to the
signed-in user's library, reusing the **same better-auth session** as the dashboard.

- **Flow:** popup "Save page to TokenItDown" → SW `handleSaveToLibrary` → content script
  `GET_PAGE_HTML` returns `document.documentElement.outerHTML` (the **live, hydrated** DOM,
  so SPA/auth-gated/dynamic content is included) → `convertHtmlToLibrary` POSTs it as an
  `.html` file to `{base}/api/convert` → markitdown converts + `saveDocument` stores it →
  popup shows Download Markdown + Open Library.
- **Auth (verified):** `host_permissions` for the platform origins + `fetch(..., {credentials:
  "include"})` makes the browser attach the better-auth session cookie to the extension's
  cross-site request — the `sameSite=lax` cookie DOES reach it (de-risk-tested live; the
  `/api/convert` route just needs the session cookie, no Origin/CSRF check on `getSession`).
- **Config (no hardcoded URLs):** `VITE_TOKENITDOWN_BASE_URL` (prod) + `VITE_TOKENITDOWN_DEV_URL`
  (localhost) live in the repo-root `.env` (documented in `.env.example`); `vite.config.ts`
  has `envDir: ".."` so the build inlines them via `import.meta.env`. The popup "Convert via"
  selector switches between them (stored in `chrome.storage`). ⚠️ `manifest.json`
  `host_permissions` must mirror these origins (Chrome needs literal match patterns).
- **Verified live against the deployed site** (`https://tokenitdown.anhourtec.com`): registered
  an account, saved example.com (→ `# Example Domain`) and iotkinect.com (313 KB rendered HTML
  → 15.4 k-char Markdown incl. footer + solution cards). 401 → "sign in" prompt. Popup UI
  checked in real Chrome. `platform.test.ts` covers `convertHtmlToLibrary` (success / trailing
  slash / 401-needsLogin / server error / network error).
- **Note:** this is the rendered-HTML path the user chose over `/convert-url` (which fetches
  raw HTML server-side with no JS). markitdown converts the whole document (no Readability),
  similar to the M1 full-body path.

## Open decisions

- **LLM provider location** (gates M3b vision-describe and M4b AI-prune — both plug into the
  existing `RegionDescriber` / `cleanMarkdown` seams): Next.js `/api/describe` route (key
  server-side) vs direct Anthropic from the extension (user key in storage) vs local Ollama
  (llava). No backend/key exists yet.

## Security model

Untrusted page content (Markdown, region labels, descriptions) only ever lands in the
**download-only** `text/markdown` Blob — never rendered as HTML anywhere in the extension.
The popup shows only numeric stats (`textContent`). `chrome.debugger` uses static CDP
commands against the user's own active tab, always detaches. The only network sink is the
"Save to TokenItDown" fetch: it sends the page HTML + session cookie ONLY to the
`host_permissions` origins (prod/localhost), and the base URL comes from env / extension-only
`chrome.storage` (a web page can't change it). ⚠️ If a future milestone renders Markdown as
HTML in-popup, sanitize it (DOMPurify) first.
